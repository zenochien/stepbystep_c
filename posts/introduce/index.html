<p>This in-depth immersion into the Object-oriented programming (OOP) and .NET Core worlds is
profitable to anyone interested in writing best-in-class applications.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</h2>
<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong>, Overview of OOP in .NET Core and C#, contains an overview of Object-orientedprogramming (OOP) and how it applies to C#. This chapter serves as a refresher of the important
constructs and features of OOP and C#, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong>, Modern Software Design Patterns and Principles, catalogs and introduces different
patterns used in modern software development. This chapter investigates a number of patterns and
catalogs, such as SOLID, Gang of Four, and enterprise integration patterns, as well as a discussion of the software development lifecycle and other practices for software development.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong>, Implementing Design Patterns - Basics Part 1, deep dives into design patterns used to
build applications in C#. Using the development of an example application, test-driven development,
minimum viable product, and other patterns from the Gang of Four will be illustrated.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong>, Implementing Design Patterns - Basics Part 2, continues the deep dive into design patterns used to build applications in C#. The concepts of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control will be introduced as well, continuing to explore design patterns including the Singleton and Factory patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong>, Implementing Design Patterns - .NET Core, builds upon chapters 3 and 4 by exploring
patterns provided by the .NET Core. Several patterns, including Dependency Injection and the
Factory pattern, will be revisited using the .NET Core framework.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong>, Implementing Design Patterns for Web Applications - Part 1, continues to explore .NET
Core by looking at the features supported in web application development by continuing to build the
sample application. This chapter offers guidance on creating an initial web application, discusses theimportant characteristics of a web application, and introduces how to create CRUD website pages.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7</strong>, Implementing Design Patterns for Web Applications - Part 2, continues the exploration of web application development using .NET Core by looking at different architectural patterns, as well as solution security patterns. Authentication and authorization are covered as well. Unit tests are added including using the Moq mocking framework.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8</strong>, Concurrent Programming in .NET Core, dives deeper into web application development to
discuss concurrency in C# and .NET Core application development. The Async/await pattern is explored, as well as a section about multithreading and concurrency. Parallel LINQ is also covered,
including delayed execution and thread priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9</strong>, Functional Programming Practices, explores functional programming in .NET Core. This
includes illustrating the C# language features that support functional programming and applying them
to the sample application, including applying the strategy pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 10</strong>, Reactive Programming Patterns and Techniques, continues to build upon .NET Core web application development by exploring reactive programming patterns and techniques used to build responsive and scalable websites. In this chapter, the principles of reactive programming are explored, including the Reactive and IObservable patterns. Different frameworks are also discussed, including the popular .NET Rx Extensions, as well as an illustration of the Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 11</strong>, Advanced Database Design and Application Techniques, explores patterns used in
database design, including a discussion of databases. A practical example of applying the Command
Query Responsibility Segregation pattern is shown, including using a ledger-style database design.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12</strong>, Coding for the Cloud, looks at application development as it applies to cloud-based
solutions, including the five key concerns of scalability, availability, security, application design, and DevOps. Significant patterns used in cloud-based solutions are explained, including different types of scaling, and patterns used in event-driven architecture, federated security, cache, and telemetry.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix A</strong>, Miscellaneous Best Practices, wraps up the discussion of patterns by covering additional patterns and best practices. This includes a section about use case modeling, best practices, and additional patterns such as space-based architecture and containerized applications.</p>
