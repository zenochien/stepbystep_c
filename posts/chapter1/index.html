<h2 id="explaine-oop">Explaine OOP</h2>
<p>The main problem with these two approaches is that programs are not easily manageable once they
grow. Programs with more complex and larger code bases strain these two approaches, leading to
difficult-to-understand and difficult-to-maintain applications. To overcome such problems, OOP
provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>!!!</strong> <em>Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are sometimes referred to as the three pillars of OOP</em></p>
<h2 id="types-of-inheritance">Types of inheritance</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit the <strong>PetAnimal</strong> class previously mentioned and, instead, use inheritance to define our
<em>Dog</em> and <em>Cat</em> classes. With inheritance, we can define some attributes that are common for both.
For example, the name of the pet and the color of the pet would be common, so they would be
located in a base class. The specifics of a cat or a dog would then be defined in a specific
class; for example, the sound the cat and dog make. The following diagram illustrates a
<em>PetAnimal</em> base class with two child classes:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/1.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h2>
<p>C# supports different levels of access that can be set on an item.An item could be a class, a class&rsquo;s
attribute or method, or an enumeration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>: This indicates that access is available outside the item.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: This indicates that only the object has access to the item.</li>
<li><strong>Protected</strong>: This indicates that only the object (and objects of classes that extended the class)
can access the attribute or method.
Internal: This indicates that only objects within the same assembly have access to the item.</li>
<li><strong>Protected Internal</strong>: This indicates that only the object (and objects of classes that extended the class) can access the attribute or method within the same assembly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is another fundamental concept in OOP where the details of a class, that is, the
attributes and methods, can be visible or not visible outside the object. With encapsulation, a
developer is providing guidance on how a class should be used as well as helping to prevent a class
from being handled incorrectly. For example, let&rsquo;s say we wanted to only allow adding
PetAnimal objects by using the AddPet(PetAnimal) method. We would do this by having the PetOwner class&rsquo;s
AddPet(PetAnimal) method available while having the Pets attribute restricted to anything outside the
PetAnimal class. In C#, this is possible by making the Pets attribute private. One reason for doing this
would be if additional logic was required whenever a PetAnimal class was added, such as logging or
validating that the PetOwner class could have a pet.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Three main features: inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Using these features, the classes within an application can be abstracted to provide definitions that are both easy to understand and portected againns being used in a mananer that is inconsistent with its purpose. This is an essential difference between OOP  used in a manaer that is software developmnet language such as structural and procedural programming. With the ability to abstract functionality, the ability to reuse and maintain code is increased.
In the next chapter, we will discuss various patterns used enterprise software development. We will cover programming patterns as well as software development principles and principles and patterns used in wellcover programming patterns as software development principles and patterns used in the <strong>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</strong></p>
<h2 id="modern-software-design-patterns-and-principles">Modern Software Design Patterns and Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</li>
<li>Design principles, including SOLID</li>
<li>Pattern catalogs, including <strong>Gang of Four (GoF)</strong> patterns and <strong>Enterprise Integration Pattern (EIP)</strong></li>
<li>Software development life cycle patterns</li>
<li>Patterns and practices for solution development, cloud development, and service development</li>
