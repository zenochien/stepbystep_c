          <h2 id="implementing-design-patterns-for-web-applications">Implementing Design Patterns for Web Applications</h2>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a .NET Core web application</li>
<li>Crafting a web application</li>
<li>Implementing CRUD pages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-net-core-web-application">Creating a .Net Core web application</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter, we discussed our FlixOne console-based application, and there are
various reasons to go with a web application as identified by the business team. Now it&rsquo;s time to
make changes in the application. In this section, we will start the creation of a new UI of our existing
FlixOne application with a new look and feel. We will also discuss all the requirements and
initialization.</p>
<h2 id="kicking-off-the-project">Kicking off the project</h2>
<p>In continuation of our existing FlixOne console application, management has decided to revamp our
FlixOne Inventory console application with a lot of features. Management came to the conclusion that
we have to convert our existing console application into a web-based solution.</p>
<p>The tech team and the business team sat down together and identified the various reasons why the
decision was made to scrap the current console application:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interface is not interactive.</li>
<li>The application is not available everywhere.</li>
<li>It is complex to maintain.</li>
<li>The growing business needs a scalable system with higher performance and adaptability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="developing-requirements">Developing requirements</h2>
<p>The following list of requirements was produced as the outcome of the discussions. The high-level
requirements identified are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product categorization</li>
<li>Product addition</li>
<li>Product updating</li>
<li>Product deletion
The actual requirements that the business demands fall on the developers. These technical
requirements include the following:</li>
<li><strong>A landing or home page</strong>: This should be a dashboard that contains various widgets, and it should show a summary of the store.</li>
<li><strong>A product page</strong>: This should have the ability to add, update, and delete products and categories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crafting-a-web-application">Crafting a web application</h2>
<p>According to the requirements just discussed, our main goal is to convert our existing console
application to a web application. In the process of this conversion, we will discuss various design
patterns for web applications, and the importance of these design patterns in the context of web
applications.</p>
<h2 id="web-applications-and-how-they-work">Web applications and how they work</h2>
<p>A web application serves requests and responses via browsers, mainly through the use of HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
<img src="../../img/58.jpg" alt="image">
The web application requires a web server (such as IIS or Apache) to manage requests coming from
the client (from the browser, as can be seen in the previous diagram). An application server (such as
IIS or Apache Tomcat) is also required to perform the tasks requested. A database is sometimes
needed to store the information as well.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I will describe the working process of the web application using the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
If we were to visualize the MVC model, then it would work as shown in the following diagram:
<img src="../../img/60.jpg" alt="image">
The preceding screenshot is a simple product listing, and it represents the Read section of the CRUDoperations. On this screen, the application shows the total available products and their categories.
The following diagram depicts how our application interacts:

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The main goal of this chapter was to start a basic web application.</p>
<p>We started the chapter by discussing business requirements, why we needed a web application, and
why we wanted to upgrade our console application. We then covered the step-by-step creation of a
web application using Visual Studio in the MVC pattern. We also discussed how a web application
can work as a client-server model, and looked at user interface patterns. We also started building
CRUD pages.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will continue with the web application and discuss more design patterns for
web applications.</p>
